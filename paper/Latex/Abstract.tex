The following system facilitates two-way radio communication between devices with a physical network interface. Although it can be used to directly connect two devices with network capabilities, it can also bridge subnetworks. As it provides DHCP server capabilities, it is a plug and play system. The components of the system are portable, requiring low power usage, and can provide a connection in ranges over 10 km, so it can be a powerful tool for utilizing myriad networking technologies.
